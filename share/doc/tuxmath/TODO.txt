TODO.txt for "tuxmath"

2009.Mar.12
These are the main (difficult) issues we would like to tackle
at some point:
1. svg support
2. stand-alone, GUI config/admin program
3. client/server model to support LAN multiplayer play

We also need to get SDL_Pango support functioning in the Windows
build, if possible.

Older stuff:
2007.Oct.08
Build:
  * Make a relocatable binary for Linux (klik package?)
  * Refine NSIS installer for Windows (or perhaps executable
    itself) to create Start Menu link to options.txt file

Graphics:
  * Make game more "themable" (there is a pending request for an
    "Egyptian" theme with pyramids and an "Islands" theme with
    palm trees, etc.)
  * svg support - allow game to draw correctly at any resolution.

Interface:
  * Add more sound effects and music files
  * Speech mode
  * Add option for number-keys to control main menu and possible options
    (for mouseless scenarios where arrow keys might not be the available...
    is there such a thing as numeric-only keyboards for PCs???)
  * Implement lockfile to prevent multiple invocations.

Game Play:
  * More entertaining "victory" and "defeat" screens
  * Add option to review missed questions to end-of-game screens
  * Add option to play next game using missed questions from current game
  * End-of-level calculations, bonuses and animations
  * "Lesson server" with login - keep track of lessons completed, percent
    correct, etc. on a per-user basis, even if installation doesn't have 
    students log into computers individually.
  * Multiplayer mode - points go to whoever shoots the comet first.
  * Re-examine algorithm for spacing of comets (allow game to deliver
    problems faster even if the comet speed limit is not raised).

Documentation:
  * Finish README.txt
  * Finish INSTALL.txt

Options:
  * Make use of some of function keys(F1-F12) to toggle settings in-game
    (perhaps speed control, muting of music)
  * Save options.
  * Admin options screen / files
  * Command-line options based on grade-level (?)
  * Internationalization - use gettext() for all strings
  * Install some kind of security on --homedir, to make sure that
    tuxmath can write but that students can't edit the files by hand?

Code:
  * Optimize graphics blitting!!!
  * Abstract SDL_BlitSurface() calls

Website:
  * Make something more user-friendly
