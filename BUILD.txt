  Building and Sugarizing Tuxmath
 =================================

Build platform: Sugar 0.82.1 + Fedora 9
Root privileges are required to install build dependencies.


1) Install required packages to compile tuxmath

yum install SDL_Pango-devel.i386 SDL-devel.i386 SDL-static.i386 SDL_image-devel.i386 SDL_mixer-devel.i386 SDL_ttf-devel.i386


2) Download tuxmath source code

wget \
  --no-check-certificate \
  https://alioth.debian.org/frs/download.php/2971/tuxmath_w_fonts-1.7.2.tar.gz
tar zxpvf tuxmath_w_fonts-1.7.2.tar.gz
cd tuxmath_w_fonts-1.7.2


3) Configure

PREFIX=/home/olpc/Activities/Tuxmath.activity
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX


4) Change Tuxmath language files if required

Language files are located in the "po" folder.
The following commands show how to substitute the Spanish translation.

The new Spanish translation is in file "po/es.po.new".

cd po
# Backup the original files
mv es.gmo es.gmo.`date '+%Y-%m-%d'`
mv es.po es.po.`date '+%Y-%m-%d'`
# Change new translation file name
mv es.po.new es.po
# Rebuild GMO file
make update-gmo
cd ..

By now, we should have a new "es.gmo" file.
If TuxMath is already installed, you can substitute the locale file without
reinstalling everything:

# Let's backup the original file, just in case
ORIG_FILE="$PREFIX/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/tuxmath.mo"
mv $ORIG_FILE $ORIG_FILE.`date '+%Y-%m-%d'`
# Now we can safely substitute the language file
cp po/es.gmo $ORIG_FILE



5) Compile and install tuxmath

make
make install

The installation process will create directories "bin" and "share" inside the PREFIX directory.


6) The "sugarization" process required to add the following components to the PREFIX directory:

* "activity" folder
* "lib" folder (with required libraries to run sugarized activities)
* "bin/tuxmath-activity" script
* "setup.py" script (to build an XO bundle)


7) Internationalization (i18n) of the Python code

Reference for this section:
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Python_i18n

cd $HOME/Activities/Tuxmath.activity
# Create the "po/Tuxmath.pot" file:
./setup.py genpot
# Complete the first lines of the "po/Tuxmath.pot" file with the version
# information, your e-mail, etc.
# Initialize a translation file for a given language (e.g. Spanish):
cd po
msginit -o es.po -l es
# Check that the Context-type line looks like this:
#   "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"
# The former command creates file "es.po", which should contain the Spanish
# translation. You may see some errors about a "team-address" file not found,
# but the translation file is created anyway.

Modify the "es.po" file to add the Spanish translations.
The command that builds the Sugar bundle will also create a "locale" folder
in the bundle folder containing the binary maps of the translations.




Current problems:

* A new user is created to run the activity every time. This creates a new directory inside "$HOME/isolation/1/uid_to_home_dir" every time the activity is run, so it's impossible to keep scores and other information.
